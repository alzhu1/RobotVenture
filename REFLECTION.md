# Reflection
This was quite a fun project! I've only worked with Unity for about 3 months (at the time of writing), and I'm very pleased with how this turned out. It's not perfect; there were a few bugs and glitches that I couldn't fix in the time I had, and the game design is a bit sloppy in places. However, while the visuals are not perfect, I'm proud that I was able to make all of them myself, as with the music. Also, some code snippets were used from YouTube tutorials (e.g. Brackeys's AudioManager).

There were definitely patches of this game that could be better. More music, better sound effects, more varied art, and more animations could've made this game more aesthetically appealing. Also, the game design is not perfect; while I believe that good level design can inform the player of certain mechanics without needing to outright tell them, I wasn't able to fully capture that in this game. Some mechanics seem a bit unintuitive in hindsight, like wall jumping. Also, this game seems pretty difficult if you're not used to the controls. The trap of working on a game long enough to get pretty good at playing it means that easy obstacles for the developer might actually be very difficult for players going in blind. I definitely want to work on improving all of these skills.

Overall, though, I am extremely pleased with the final result. I'm glad I decided to see this project through to the end, and I'm hoping to continue making even better games in the future!
